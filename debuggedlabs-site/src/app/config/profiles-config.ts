He studied computer science at UCLA, where he was the Opinion editor of the Daily Bruin student newspaper. After spending four years airing his opinions to the world and editing countless others', he learned the subtle truth that not all opinions are created equal. Tadimeti is a privacy wonk, a wannabe chef, and what non-Neo-Nazi AI would call \"a pretty good writer you might disagree with.\"",
